# Data Collection Module

This module is responsible for gathering information from various technology platforms. Think of it as a digital librarian that collects interesting discussions, trends, and updates from the tech world.

## How It Works

### 1. GitHub Collector (`github_fetcher.py`)
This component tracks what developers are building and discussing on GitHub. It:
- Monitors popular repositories
- Collects information about new projects
- Tracks trending programming languages
- Analyzes commit messages to understand what developers are working on

### 2. Stack Overflow Collector (`so_fetcher.py`)
This part focuses on what developers are asking and learning about:
- Gathers recent questions and their topics
- Tracks popular programming problems
- Identifies common coding challenges
- Monitors trending technologies through questions

### 3. Reddit Collector (`reddit_fetcher.py`)
This component analyzes discussions in technology-focused communities:
- Follows conversations in programming subreddits
- Captures trending topics and discussions
- Identifies popular learning resources
- Tracks career-related discussions

### 4. Utilities (`utils.py`)
This helper module contains common tools used by all collectors:
- Data formatting functions
- API connection handlers
- Error management
- Data validation tools

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have the required API keys in your `.env` file
2. Run the collector you need:
   ```python
   from fetch_sources import github_fetcher
   
   # Collect GitHub data
   github_data = github_fetcher.fetch_latest_data()
   ```

## Data Format

All collectors format their data in a consistent way:
```json
{
    "source": "platform_name",
    "timestamp": "2024-03-20T10:30:00Z",
    "content": "The main text or content",
    "tags": ["relevant", "tags"],
    "metadata": {
        "url": "source_url",
        "author": "content_creator",
        "platform_specific_data": "value"
    }
}
```

## Error Handling

The module includes proper error handling for common issues:
- Network connection problems
- API rate limits
- Invalid data formats
- Missing credentials

## Configuration

Each collector can be configured through environment variables:
- API keys and secrets
- Rate limiting settings
- Data filtering options
- Output preferences
