# Insights Engine

This is the brain of our project that helps predict and understand technology trends. It's like a weather forecast system, but instead of predicting rain, it predicts which technologies will become popular.

## Components

### 1. Trend Monitor (`monitor.py`)
Watches for important changes:
- Tracks sudden increases in topic mentions
- Identifies emerging patterns
- Monitors technology adoption rates
- Detects trending discussions

### 2. Forecasting System (`forecast.py`)
Predicts future trends:
- Uses machine learning for predictions
- Analyzes historical patterns
- Identifies seasonal trends
- Calculates confidence scores

### 3. Alert Generator (`alert.py`)
Creates smart notifications:
- Generates trend alerts
- Sends important updates
- Manages notification priorities
- Customizes alert messages

### 4. Data Storage (`trend_storage.py`)
Manages historical information:
- Stores trend data
- Tracks pattern history
- Manages data lifecycle
- Provides quick data access

### 5. Main Runner (`run_insights.py`)
Controls the entire system:
- Coordinates all components
- Schedules analysis tasks
- Manages system resources
- Handles error recovery

## How It Works

1. Data Processing:
   ```python
   from insights_engine import monitor
   
   # Start monitoring trends
   monitor.track_trends()
   ```

2. Getting Predictions:
   ```python
   from insights_engine import forecast
   
   # Get future trends
   predictions = forecast.predict_next_week()
   ```

## Output Examples

### Trend Alert
```json
{
    "alert_type": "emerging_trend",
    "technology": "Rust Programming",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "supporting_data": {
        "mention_increase": "150%",
        "time_frame": "Last 48 hours",
        "key_indicators": ["GitHub activity", "Stack Overflow questions"]
    }
}
```

### Forecast
```json
{
    "trend": "Cloud Computing",
    "forecast": {
        "1_month": "Strong growth",
        "3_months": "Continued adoption",
        "6_months": "Market stabilization"
    },
    "confidence_score": 0.78
}
```
