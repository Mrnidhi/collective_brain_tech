# Trend Analysis Module

This module is like a smart detective that looks through all the collected data to find interesting patterns and trends. It helps us understand what's becoming popular in the tech world.

## Main Components

### 1. Data Cleaning (`cleaner.py`)
Before we can analyze the data, we need to clean it:
- Removes unnecessary information
- Fixes formatting issues
- Standardizes text
- Handles missing data

### 2. Information Extraction (`extractor.py`)
This component pulls out the important information:
- Identifies key topics and technologies
- Extracts programming languages mentioned
- Finds important technical terms
- Recognizes names of tools and frameworks

### 3. Pattern Analysis (`analyzer.py`)
This is where we find the interesting trends:
- Spots rising topics
- Identifies declining technologies
- Compares trends across platforms
- Calculates popularity scores

### 4. Data Visualization (`visualizer.py`)
This component creates easy-to-understand visuals:
- Generates trend graphs
- Creates word clouds
- Plots platform comparisons
- Shows historical data

### 5. Pipeline Runner (`run_trends.py`)
This is the main script that:
- Coordinates all components
- Manages the analysis workflow
- Handles data flow
- Saves results

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have processed data from the fetch_sources module
2. Run the analysis:
   ```python
   python run_trends.py
   ```

## Output Format

The analysis produces structured results:
```json
{
    "trend_name": "Python",
    "metrics": {
        "popularity_score": 85,
        "growth_rate": 0.25,
        "mention_count": 1500
    },
    "context": {
        "related_topics": ["Django", "Flask", "AI"],
        "platforms": ["GitHub", "Stack Overflow"],
        "time_period": "Last 7 days"
    }
}
```

## Analysis Methods

We use several techniques to identify trends:
- Statistical analysis
- Natural Language Processing
- Time series analysis
- Pattern recognition

## Customization

You can customize the analysis by:
- Adjusting trend detection sensitivity
- Setting different time periods
- Focusing on specific technologies
- Modifying visualization styles

## Results

The analysis helps answer questions like:
- What programming languages are gaining popularity?
- Which tools are developers talking about most?
- What are the common problems people face?
- Which technologies are trending down?
